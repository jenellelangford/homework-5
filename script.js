/*
  The 5-Day Forecast actually breaks down each day's forecast into hour blocks of 3, which will be 
  really hard to parse. The function below will solve the problem: 
    1) Create a global variable called forecastArray
    2) After you make your 5-Day Forecast API call, call this function and pass in the list of weather objects
        (response.list)
    3. Once this function is done, your global forecast array will be populated.
    4. Then loop through that array to create the 5 blue blocks at the bottom
    5. You're welcome.  :)
